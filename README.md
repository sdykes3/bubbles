# bubbles
Small bubble popping simulation, made in Processing

This a simple coding exercise, designed to create a small-scale play experience 
using a familiar platform and the affordances it gives. Processing was chosen due to 
the ease with which one can determine mouse position and draw simple shapes.
This simulation is minimally interactive, as hovering is the only significant action the user can take.
